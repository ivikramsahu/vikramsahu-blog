    <p>
      Hi, I’m Vikram Sahu — a Developer Relations Engineer who thrives at the intersection of
      code, community, and conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
      By day, I help bridge the gap between developers and products—making tools, platforms,
      and APIs more usable and building engaging developer experiences. By night, I write. I
      explore tech trends, experiment with code, and demystify complex ideas into something
      useful, usable, and (dare I say) fun.
    </p>

    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Community First:</strong> I believe great tech isn’t just built—it’s shared.
      Whether through talks, workshops, or blog posts, helping developers learn and grow is
      my guiding principle.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Clarity over Complexity:</strong> Tech can be messy. My goal is to make it less
      intimidating. From deep dives into APIs to debugging best practices, I aim to simplify
      without losing nuance.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Hands-On Learning:</strong> I’m a strong advocate of learning by doing. I
      experiment, fail, try again—and share everything along the way.
    </p>

    <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Practical guides, tutorials, and how-tos—from integrating APIs to building
        components.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reflections on DevRel: what works, what doesn’t, and how developer communities
        evolve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Insights on the latest in tech: tools, platforms, and trends I'm excited about (or
        skeptical of).
      </li>
      <li>
        Stories from the field—mistakes made, lessons learned, and ideas that changed my
        perspective.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why I Write</h2>

    <p>
      Because every engineer has something to teach, and every developer community has
      something to learn. My blog is my lab, my launchpad, and my way of giving back. If
      you’re exploring DevRel, curious about tooling, or just want to see tech through
      someone else’s lens, you’re in good company.
    </p>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by. Let’s build something together.</p>
